# UFC-Predictions

## Business Questions:
1. Can you predict the outcome of the next UFC fight?
2. Can you predict the method of victory (KO, DEC, SUB)?
3. Can you predict what round the fight will end (1,2,3) or (1,2,3,4,5)?

## About the Data:
* The data is from ufcstats.com and contains 76 crucial variables for predictions. Some of the variables per fighter include age, reach, wins, losses, draws, and average number of significant strikes
* Each data set is broken down by weight class and sex (male, female) prior to EDA, scaling, modeling, etc.

## Models:
1. Winner: (RED, BLUE)
* Utilizing binary classification models such as Decision Trees, KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM
2. Method of Victory: (KO, DEC, SUB)
* Utilizing nonbinary classification models such as Random Forest Classifiers, KNN, and Logistic Regression
3. Round End: (1,2,3) or (1,2,3,4,5)
* Utilizing nonbinary classification models such as Random Forest Classifiers, KNN, and Logistic Regression

## Final Notes:
* The combination of all the models will give you a robust understanding of who will when upcoming fights based on historical data.
* Classification is a power supervised machine learning technique with endless business applications
